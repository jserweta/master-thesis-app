# Master Thesis App

App created for my master thesis under the title "Stock market analysis portal".

## How to run project

The build folder is ready to be deployed.\
You may serve it with a static server:

npm install -g serve
serve -s build

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
